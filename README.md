# SSG-Synth
YM2149F SSG audio synthesizer with midi interface, Arduino based.

We chose to use Arduino Uno in order to create a final product that is simple to setup and robust, thanks to the ability to easily stack shields.

### Roadmap
* 0.0 :heavy_check_mark: Create Arduino and GitHub project :smile:
* 0.1 :x: [hardware] setup and document project (YM2149F breadboard setup, midi interface)
* 0.2 :x: [code] control SSG chip using an Arduino Uno
* 0.3 :x: [code] receive midi signals with Arduino
* 0.4 :x: [code] control SSG chip using midi signals
* 0.5 :x: [hardware] from breadboard to custom shield
* 0.6 :x: [doc] examples and tutorial
